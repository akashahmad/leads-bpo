<h2 className="termsandcondition-heading">Our Cookies</h2>

</div>
<div>  <p className="ap">
National Debt Help’ website(s) (our website(s)) uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our <nr/>
website(s).This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website(s) and <br/>
also allows us to improve our website(s). This policy explains what we mean by “cookies”,
 the cookies <br/>
 we use on our website(s), what the cookies do, how long they last for and where you can find out more<br/>
 information about them.</p>
 <p className="ap">What are cookies?</p>
 <p className="ap">Cookies are pieces of data created when you visit a website, and contain a unique, identification <br/>
 number. Some cookies are stored in the cookie directory of your hard drive, and do not expire at the <br/>end of your session. Cookies do not contain any personal information about you and cannot be used to<br/> identify an individual user.</p>

</div>
  <div>
  <p className="ap">
      Cookies have a lifetime. Many only last until you close your browser or for a short time. These <br/>
       called ‘session cookies’. Some last far longer though, for example, to enable a website to recognise <br/>
       you when you return to them. These are called ‘persistent cookies’. Where possible, we’ll let you know <br/>
       how long these cookies last for.

  
      </p>
      <p className="ap">Cookies set directly by a website owner (like us) are generally known as ‘first party cookies’. Many <br/>
       (if not most) modern websites also use bits of hidden technology provided by other parties. Online <br/>
       advertising is a particularly common example. These other parties may also set cookies when you use<br/>
        our website. If they do so, their cookies are generally known as ‘third party cookies’.</p>


  <p className="ap">There are some other computer technologies which are technically different to cookies but are used to <br/>perform very similar jobs and function in a very similar way. For example, ‘locally stored objects'(or <br/>
‘flash cookies’) are used to power some online video content, and ‘web bugs'(or ‘web beacons’) are <br/>
used for many of the same purposes as cookies. When we provide services to you through our <br/>
website, we want to make them easy to use, useful and reliable. Cookies are used to improve services<br/>
 for you through, for example:</p>
 <p className="ap">enabling a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to give the same information several <br/>
 times during one task;</p>
 <p className="ap">recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for <br/>
  every web page requested; and measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made <br/>
 easier to use and there is enough capacity to ensure they are fast. Now that we have explained what <br/>
 cookies are, please read “Our use of cookies” to understand why we use them.

 </p></div>
<div>
 <h2 className="termsandcondition-heading">First party cookies</h2>
